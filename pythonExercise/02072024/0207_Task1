Task #1

Q. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
A: The = operator is used for assignment, like assigning a value to a variable.
eg: a = 5.
The == operator is the relational operator for comparing two values.
If the values are the same, it will return True, and will return False otherwise.
eg: 10 == 10 this would return True.

Q. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
A: ** is an Exponentiation operator.
eg: if a = 7 and b = 2 then print(a**b) would print 49.

Q. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
A: Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise calculations on integers. ^ is an Bitwise XOR operator.
Results bit 1,if any of the operand bit is 1 but not both, otherwise results bit 0.
eg: if a = 10 and b = 2 then print(a^b) would print 8.
