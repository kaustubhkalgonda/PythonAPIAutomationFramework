# âœ… Leap Year Checker:
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
# Input = 2024 Output = Leap year

print("***Program to check Leap Year***")
year = int(input("Enter year: "))

if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
        print("This is Leap Year")
    else:
        print("This is not a Leap Year")
elif year % 4 == 0:
    print("This is Leap Year")
else:
    print("This is not a Leap Year")
